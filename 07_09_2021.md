# Day 1 with Motional

Tasks: the
1. Onboard Training

## Perception and Prediction

### Overview

1. we build models to understand the world around us. 
2. Planning, and controls utilizes our understanding of the world to navigate to our goals. 
3. We research, train, and deploy machine learning (usually neural network aka deep learning) models. 

We are part of the Autonomous sensing & Services and work closely with Autonomy Platform and Autonomy Metrics teams to model the world. 

We are customers of **Localization** and suppliers to **Planning** and **Controls**. 

### Tenets 
1. we believe in thoroughly verifying our training and testing data. 
2. We believe that ML is best done by end-to-end parameters optimization from input to targets. 
3. We implement approppriate unit, regression, and integration tasks to ensure our models behave as expected during training and deployment.
