# View C++ as a federation of languages. 

In the beginning, C++ was just C with some object-oriented features tacked on. The easiest way is to view C++ not as a single language but as a federation of related languages. Within a particular sublanguage, the rules tend to be simple, straightforward, and easy to remember.
1. **C**: Way down deep. C++ is still based on C. 
2. **Object-Oriented C++** : This part of C++ is what C with Classes was all about: classes (including constructors and destructors), encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions (dynamic binding), etc. This is the part of C++ to which the classic rules for object-oriented design most directly apply.
3. **Template C++** : This is the generic programming part of C++, the one that most programmers have the least experience with. In fact, templates are so powerful, they give rise to a completely new programming paradigm, template metaprogramming (TMP).
4. **The STL** : The STL is a template library. Its conventions regarding containers, iterators, algorithms, and function objects mesh beautifully, but templates and libraries can be built around other ideas, too.

**Things to remember**
Rules for effective C++ programming vary, depending on the part of C++ you are using.
